# jolabot
 
1-day holiday project for controlling a robot remotely via web page<br>

For this project I had to:<br>

- Create a web page that displays video and arrow keys to send commands to the robot.<br>
- Make the robot run a server that accepts control commands (forwards, backwards, left and right).<br>
- Live stream video from the robots camera to the web page to display.<br>
- Make the robot actually move<br>
